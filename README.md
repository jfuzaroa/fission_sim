# Simulations of Ternary Fission

## Introduction

This is a repository including Jupyter notebooks and script files attempting to
model the dynamics of nuclear fragments at point of scission. It also includes
simulations of alpha fragment stopping power through time projection chamber
gas. This is done in collaboration with the Neutron Induced Fission Fragment
Tracking Experiment (NIFFTE) in an attempt to study the ternary to binary 
fission ratios of various fission cross-sections. **This is a work in progress**

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Jupyter
- CERN's ROOT with PyROOT
- NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
